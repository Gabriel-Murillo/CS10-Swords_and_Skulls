Whoops, accidentally deleted the entire repository instead of an old branch. This is a re-upload of my sophomore project, programmed in Python. I wanted to go for a story that was simple yet captivating, a story that gave you a reason to continue fighting. I was inspired by games of yore with simple, straightforward stories, like "The Legend of Zelda." However, the game's mechanics were inspired by modern RPGs, such as "The Witcher 3," even though I use a turn-based combat system. I hope you enjoy, and thank you for your time.
